	doi = {10.2298/SAJ2000001W},
	abstract = {I review the origins and development of the idea of Dyson spheres, their
	purpose, their engineering, and their detectability. I explicate the ways in
	which the popular imagining of them as monolithic objects would make them
	dynamically unstable under gravity and radiation pressure, and mechanically
	unstable to buckling. I develop a model for the radiative coupling between a
	star and large amounts of material orbiting it, and connect the
	observational features of a star plus Dyson sphere system to the gross
	radiative properties of the sphere itself. I discuss the still-unexplored
	problem of the effects of radiative feedback on the central star's structure
	and luminosity. Finally, I discuss the optimal sizes of Dyson spheres under
	various assumptions about their purpose as sources of low-entropy emission,
	dissipative work, or computation.
